Some mini Indivisual projects of Java
# Bank Management System
This project is about the activities of the ATM. Through this I have created a login page if user have card number and pin no we can log in through those credentials. 
If you are a new user, you have to sign in first.  This application has three series of sign in forms based on the “model-view-controller” GUI framework Swing. And data will be stored and accessed in Mysql server.
Based on the input value of card number, login page leads to the main class where we have our options such as deposit, fast cash, ministatement, pin change, Balance inquiry, withdraw etc..
